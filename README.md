#### NOTE:
<p>After starting this concept I found that an individual had already made a Baker's Percent Formula Convertor on Google Play.<br/>

<br/>
<p>I contacted them via Twitter and email and from Twiiter I got the go-ahead to do my own thing with it (but I told them I would give them a mention as they requested).</p>

* <p>"Hi 'Tok', I was working on a Baker's formula converter and found out that you have made one already. I've been wanting to finish my project but didn't want to infringe on your existing work. Would you be offend[ed] if I continued my project on the same sort of app? Would you prefer that I fork yours and contribute to your app rather than me finishing mine? Thanks, Anthony" Tue 9:35 AM (03/16/2021)</p>

* <p>"Hi. Thanks for your comment. I released the app 7 years ago. I find it outdated. So I think it's better to make a new one. If you refer to my app, I would be grateful if you could mention it somewhere. Thanks. tok" Yesterday, 7:31 PM (03/18/2021)</p>

* <p>"Hi Tok, thanks. If I release a public version I will give you a mention/credit." (03/19/2021)</p>
